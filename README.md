This application's main objective is to help young students get familiar with the concept of triangles as well as provide them a way of testing the knowledge on the same.It is a collection of 4 mini applications:
1) Check Triangle or Not: This mini application collects the measures of 3 angles from you and using it tells us whether it forms a triangle or not
2) Quiz: A quiz on triangles that helps the students check their knowledge on triangles. Correct and Incorrect answers get highlighted to let the person analyse his work.
3) Calculate Area: Students can use this calculator to verify their answers which they get manually while finding the area of different types of triangles (For example: right angled triangle,equilateral triangle,etc.).
4) Calculate Hypotenuse: Students can use this calculator to verify their answers which they get manually while finding the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle.
